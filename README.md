# Chinese word frequency

This simple Python script uses [jieba][1] to count all the words in a file and
display the most frequent ones.

Currently, it's very basic and therefore not flexible.

## Current issues and goals

- [ ] handle missing arguments
- [ ] add option for (multiple) stop lists
- [ ] add option to set delimiter
- [ ] add option to set number of words displayed in results

Have fun Chinese word frequencying!
